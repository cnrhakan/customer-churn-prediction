# Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company. By predicting churn in advance, businesses can take necessary actions to retain customers.

## 🛠️ Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## 📊 Data Preparation and Analysis
The dataset was split into training and testing data, and preprocessing steps were applied. Missing values were cleaned, categorical variables were transformed, and the data was normalized. Model performances were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

## 🚀 Future Development
In the future, more advanced analyses such as customer segmentation can be performed. This will allow for more specific grouping of customers, enabling more targeted marketing strategies.
